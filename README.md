# 🧠 Terminal Portfolio: Recon Mode Active

Welcome to my digital command center — a hacker-themed interface styled in pure terminal charisma, built to echo the mindset of discovery, strategy, and resilience. This is more than a portfolio; it's a chronicle of experiments, exploits, and ethical conquests.

## 🧠 About Me

I'm Mystique — student, strategist, and aspiring hacker. With roots in code and a flair for digital resilience, I engineer recon workflows, DSA simulations, and exploit environments that reflect both discipline and creativity. If it runs in the shadows and sparks curiosity, I’m likely building it or tracing it.

## 🌍 Contact

Let’s connect or collaborate on recon ops, backend engineering, trading strategies, or psychological profiling for code and finance. Tactical synergy welcome.

MIT License — fork, evolve, remix. Just respect the work, cite the creator, and keep things ethical.

“Reconstruct. Reconfigure. Reconquer.” — Digital mantra for trace-based resilience

If you want this copy fine-tuned for a specific repo (like your recon toolkit or DSA module), or embedded with your actual ASCII splash logo at the top — I can customize it even further. Just toss me the specs, or say “inject splash” and I’ll patch it like a seasoned sysadmin.
